suika game in 3d, but with cats neko game?
suika game smallest fruit fits 14 times on the playing board
bigest fruit fits 1.7 times
second biggest fruit fits 2.3 times

since game is 3d and we have one extra dimension, since volume goes up with the square of the area fruits should be in general larger(or at least appear larger)
smallest fruit can fit 10 times
biggest can fit 1.5 times horizontally, meaning diagonally you could fit 2 at least
dimensions
suika game has 11 levels

level 3 - 2.4
level 4 - 3.4
level 5 - 4.6 meter
